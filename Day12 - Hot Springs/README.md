# [Day 12: Hot Springs](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/12)

You've reached the hot springs, but they are in disrepair. You are given condition records for rows of springs, which are partially damaged.
Each record shows if a spring is operational (`.`), damaged (`#`), or unknown (`?`).
Alongside this, you have a list of numbers representing the sizes of contiguous groups of damaged springs.
Your task is to determine the number of possible arrangements of springs that match these criteria for each row and sum them up.
