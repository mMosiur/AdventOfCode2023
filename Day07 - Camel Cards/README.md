# [Day 7: Camel Cards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7)


The "Camel Cards" game is very similar to poker except it's designed to be easier to play while riding a camel.
You get a list of 5 card hands, and your goal is to order them based on the strength of each hand based on relative strength
of the cards and more importantly the hand type they form (five of a kind, full house, etc.).
You need to determine the total winnings based on ordered hands and their respective bids.
